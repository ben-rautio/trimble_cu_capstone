Try just using nv12 image in cv without grayscaling. Will this work with thresholding?
Results:
Thresholding values are completely different, 250 isn't creating any contours. Trying to save the image to see whats going on 
This failed, ill create a  window so that when i hit escape it will exit and save one single image the correct way...
Created a window, that will work now.

Something weird with the nv12 images is that when i view it with eog, there are sort of 2 images on top of eachother, idk why...
The thresholded image looks normal but now the regular threshold values don't really work. I have to use lower ones like 230. BUT 
I didn't have to grayscale the image because I think i am just using the intensity channel but i will double check with the shape function...
Above seems to be correct: gray image is just: img_display = img[:2464,:]. The last half of the original is just the UV channels which we don't care about!

This new method of slicing works fine. But am still getting a lot of noise from nearby lights. I will try more iterations of erosion and gaussian blur
Also: for some reason the contours aren't showing up in the saved images. Figure this out!!!!

Threshold for the LED seems to be around 232. at 240 everything is thresholded out, resulting in just a black binary image with no contours
I will see if this is the same with moving the LED much closer, to where it should obviously be the brightest thing in the frame
This worked, now i will try increasing the thresh value from 232 to 240
This resulted in no contrours, why? Maybe try printing out intensity of the 232 thresh image?
For some reason on the NV12 image intensity can only go up to 234

I will see if this is the same if i convert to gray8 format in the pipeline...
same thing, maximum of 234 for some reason. Why????
using the max() function on the image, i can see i am only getting a maximum of 235! Why??
